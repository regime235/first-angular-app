            Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by
            Activision. Starting out in 2003, it first focused on games set in World
            War II, but over time, the series has seen games set in modern times, the
            midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and outer space. The games were
            first developed by Infinity Ward, then also by Treyarch and Sledgehammer
            Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers.
            The most recent title, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, was released on October
            12, 2018. The next title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, will be released
            on October 25, 2019. The series originally focused on the World War II
            setting, with Infinity Ward developing the first (2003) and second (2005)
            titles in the series and Treyarch developing the third (2006). Call of
            Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a new, modern setting, and proved
            to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the Modern Warfare
            sub-series. The game's legacy also influenced the creation of a remastered
            version, released in 2016. Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and
            3 (2011), were made. The sub-series received a soft-reboot with Modern
            Warfare in 2019. Infinity Ward have also developed two games outside of
            the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016).
            Treyarch made one last World War II-based game, World at War (2008),
            before releasing Black Ops (2010) and subsequently creating the Black Ops
            sub-series. Three other entries, Black Ops II (2012), III (2015), and 4
            (2018), were made. Sledgehammer Games, who were co-developers for Modern
            Warfare 3, have also developed two titles, Advanced Warfare (2014) and
            WWII (2017).
